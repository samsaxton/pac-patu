## Gameplay Guide

### Objective
Navigate the Patu's Pirates waterpolo logo through the maze, collecting all waterpolo balls while avoiding pirate ship enemies. Complete levels by collecting all items and survive as long as possible to achieve high scores.

### Game Elements

#### Player Character
- **Patu's Pirates Logo**: Your controllable character
- **Mouth Animation**: Opens when eating collectibles or vulnerable enemies
- **Lives**: Start with 3 lives, lose one when touching enemies
- **Movement**: Smooth directional movement with collision detection

#### Collectibles
- **Blue Waterpolo Balls**: Standard collectibles worth 10 points each (8px radius)
  - **Color**: Distinct blue (#0080FF) with subtle glow and 3D highlight effects
  - **Formation**: Authentic waterpolo tactical formations (3-2-1 top, 2-4 bottom)
  - **Animation**: Pulsing size variation and blue particle effects on collection
- **Golden Power Pellets**: Special waterpolo balls that make enemies vulnerable (50 points, 16px radius)
  - **Visual Enhancement**: Real water polo ball images with pulsing golden glow (#FFD700)
  - **Animation Effects**: Scaling, shadow effects, and golden particle effects
  - **Strategic Placement**: Positioned in field corners for tactical gameplay

#### Enemies
- **Pirate Ships**: AI-controlled enemies with advanced behavioral systems
- **Normal State**: Default appearance, chase player with intelligent pathfinding
- **Vulnerable State**: Bright cyan glow with pulsing effects, flee from player
- **Defeated State**: Respawn from water polo goals with spawn protection
- **Advanced AI Features**:
  - **Separation Logic**: Prevents bunching and clustering
  - **Wandering Behavior**: Organic movement patterns with time-based variation
  - **Directional Changes**: Random course corrections for unpredictable movement
  - **Speed Variation**: Individual speed characteristics (0.8x to 1.2x base speed)
  - **Spawn Protection**: 1-second emergence period from goals

#### Power-Up System
- **Activation**: Collect water polo ball power pellets to activate
- **Visual Feedback**: Enemies glow with bright cyan pulsing effects
- **Behavioral Changes**: Vulnerable enemies flee from player instead of chasing
- **Bonus Points**: 200 points for each enemy defeated while vulnerable
- **No Timer**: Power-up effect continues until all vulnerable enemies are defeated or player dies
- **Strategic Gameplay**: Enemies remain vulnerable until eaten, allowing for tactical planning

#### Water Polo Goal Spawn System
- **Goal Graphics**: Realistic water polo goals with white posts and net patterns
- **Strategic Placement**: Goals positioned at top center (400, 210) and bottom center (400, 790)
- **Enemy Emergence**: All pirate ships spawn from goals, never from screen edges
- **Spawn Protection**: 1-second period where enemies slowly exit goals
- **Directional Movement**: Top goal enemies move downward, bottom goal enemies move upward
- **Visual Consistency**: Maintains waterpolo theme throughout gameplay

### Precise Formation Positioning System (Canvas: 800x600)

#### **Vector Positioning Logic**
The game uses a precise coordinate system to ensure authentic waterpolo formations:

**Power Pellet Reference Points:**
- Top Power Pellets: Y=150 (horizontal reference line)
- Bottom Power Pellets: Y=450 (horizontal reference line)
- Corner Positions: (100, 150), (700, 150), (100, 450), (700, 450)

**Formation Alignment Rules:**
1. **Top Formation (3-2-1)**: First row aligns with top power pellet Y-coordinate (150)
2. **Bottom Formation (2-4)**: Positioned between center and bottom power pellets (Y=380)
3. **Horizontal Spacing**: Uses centerX (400) as reference point for symmetric distribution

#### **Exact Coordinate Specifications**

**Top Formation (3-2-1 Offensive Pattern):**
```javascript
const topGoalY = 150; // Aligned with top power pellets
const topRowSpacing = 58; // Vertical spacing between rows
const topHorizontalSpacing = 100; // Wide spacing for 3-ball row
const topHorizontalHalf = 50; // Narrow spacing for 2-ball row

// Row 1 (3 balls): Y=150
- Left: (300, 150)   // centerX - 100
- Center: (400, 150) // centerX
- Right: (500, 150)  // centerX + 100

// Row 2 (2 balls): Y=208
- Left: (350, 208)   // centerX - 50
- Right: (450, 208)  // centerX + 50

// Row 3 (1 ball): Y=266
- Center: (400, 266) // centerX
```

**Bottom Formation (2-4 Defensive Pattern):**
```javascript
const bottomGoalY = 380; // Positioned towards center from power pellets
const bottomRowSpacing = 90; // Vertical spacing between rows
const bottomHorizontalHalf = 50; // Inner ball spacing
const bottomHorizontalWide = 150; // Outer ball spacing (increased for even distribution)

// Row 1 (2 balls): Y=380
- Left: (350, 380)   // centerX - 50
- Right: (450, 380)  // centerX + 50

// Row 2 (4 balls): Y=470
- Far Left: (250, 470)  // centerX - 150
- Left: (350, 470)      // centerX - 50
- Right: (450, 470)     // centerX + 50
- Far Right: (550, 470) // centerX + 150
```

#### **Formation Adjustment Guidelines**
When modifying formations, follow these vector principles:

1. **Vertical Alignment**: Use power pellet Y-coordinates as reference lines
2. **Horizontal Distribution**: Calculate from centerX (400) with symmetric offsets
3. **Even Spacing**: Ensure outer balls have wider spacing than inner balls for visual balance
4. **Tactical Authenticity**: Maintain 3-2-1 offensive and 2-4 defensive waterpolo patterns

### Game States
1. **Menu**: Starting screen with game information
2. **Playing**: Active gameplay state
3. **Paused**: Game temporarily stopped (press P)
4. **Game Over**: All lives lost or game completed
